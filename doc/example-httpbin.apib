# Second request and response

Get unauthorized.

Also note that we don't expect any body.

The current date will be available to use in later requests as `{{<some_date}}.`

< Www-Authenticate: Basic realm="Fake Realm"
< Date: {{>some_date}}


# Third request

Note that the title of this operation is "Third request", but that's just
markdown for you. You don't need to include a title, or even a description of
the operations unless you want to. In the fourth request we will skip the
description altogether.

Here we are getting a cached response.
